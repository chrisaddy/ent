# ent

ent is an extension of taskwarrior that treats your tasks as a forest of deeply nested task trees.

Get it? task _warrior_, task _forest_? _tree_ _warrior_, _ent_? Get it? GET IT? Lord of the Rings for you non-nerds.

When working through your todos you should only see those things which are immediately actionable. If a task is not immediately actionable, it is a project, or a sub project, or a sub-sub-project. Either way, you should always look to subtask until your see only the terminal nodes of all the trees in your forest. This is a glance at what can be done now.

As you check things off the tree, the parent nodes now become actionable (or if not, add more tasks), now you can do them.

Taskwarrior has this concept built in, i.e., dependencies and blockers. This is just a way to simplify viewing them.
